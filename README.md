Advanced Level Telecom Training Centre (ALTTC), Ghaziabad is the apex training institute 
of BSNL.ALTTC was set up as a joint venture of International Telecommunication Union, Geneva, 
UNDP and the Government of India in 1975. ALTTC functions on the frontiers of telecom 
technology, finance and management and imparts training to the leaders in the business. The 
strength of ALTTC lies in the state of art labs, massive infrastructure and trained, talented and 
qualified human resource pool.

The Centre's Mission statement is "To Deliver Excellence Through Training"!

# GENERAL OVERVIEW
The Objective of this project is to implement Smart Home with the help of the simulator.
The tool chosen for the simulations is Cisco Packet Tracer. Main strength of the tool is the offering of a 
variety of network components that simulate a real network, devices would then need to be interconnected 
and configured to create a network. In the last version of the tool Cisco introduced IOT functionalities, and 
now it is possible to add to the network smart devices, components, sensors, actuators, and devices that 
simulate microcontrollers. All the IOT devices can run on standard programs or can be customized by 
programming them with Java, Python. This makes Cisco Packet Tracer an ideal tool for building Smart 
Home practical simulations.
# Advantages and Disadvantages of Smart Building
# Advantages
• More secure and safe home.
• Simplified staff tracking.
• Minimal administration costs.
• Less costs by sharing infrastructure.
• University systems by easier integration.
• Information can be transferred to everyone in any manner. 
• Increased mobility-not tied to a specialist workstation.
• Using standard operating environments training is minimized.
# Disadvantages.
• Complexity of system is more.
• Initial cost is very high.

In this section we implemented the various smart home cases. The purpose is to analyze the network and IOT 
layout in a smart building

STEPS
A. Drag a home gateway on the packet tracer workspace.
B. Configure the network if any changes required from the default.
                  1.SSID: Home Gateway 
                  2.LAN: 192.168.25.1

ABSTRACT
Today's society needs technology. There is a need to have a smart home that 
can turn a smart device on or off via a smartphone. Earlier we used to press the 
switch or remote button to turn the device on or off. To design smart home in 
cisco Packet Tracer using IoT where we can test system, check Network 
configuration. Through smartphones we can test various IoT devices that can 
be controlled and monitored.
IOE devices are connected to internet to allow the distant monitoring and 
controlling of different home appliances such as lighting, heating, cooling, and alarming.
CISCO PACKET TRACER simulation software is used to implement smart 
home. The features include different sensor, actuator and different smart devices 
which is used for home automation.

This home is the variation of the first home. This home can be remotely controlled by the 3G network 
Smartphone. The IOT intelligence is remotely provided by the remote provider as a service.
In the above architecture of smart home all the devices are connected to Home Gateway wirelessly and 
wired medium. The backend logic was provided by the remote connection to cloud server hosted by a third 
party. The user has ability to connect to IOT control page using a Smartphone remotely via a 5G network
# The network layout in this smart home is as follows
